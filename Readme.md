# Motivation

This may be a useful c program to learn the core concepts of c programming for begineer.

# Need of Program

As you know, we uses a calculator to make our calculations fast and accurate, but generally we don't have calculator that can evaluate the Hcf and Lcm of two Nos. That is why, I developed this console c program so that I can calculate this easily without any mistake.

# Build Status

This is a console program, it takes two no. from user and using the function `hcf()` and `lcm()` it is passed and with the use of **Euclids Division Lema** the calculation is taken further and as the per the user choice it shows the output.
